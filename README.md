# Next Step Safeguarding

My static website will be based on a fictitious walking group called Next Step and will feature their webpages on safeguarding and how they approach safeguarding issues in the club. I was inspired to create some webpages on the topic of safeguarding because it was a task we had to complete as part of the university walking club I was a part of. I think it is an absolutely vital topic to learn about so my aim is to create an easy to use site with clear information and call to action points in case the need to report a safeguarding issue occurs. 

- Add an image of the finished site here. I like to use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) to get an image of my site on all device sizes, and amiresponsive allows you to click links on the page and scroll, so each device can show a different element of your site.

- Add a link to the live site here, for Milestone 1 this will be the GitHub Pages Link from when you deployed the site.

## User Experience (UX)

## Initial Discussion

Next Step is a website for a fictitious walking group local to Sheffield. The website requires some pages on safeguarding so that it's members are aware of the topic and know what to do if a safeguarding concern arises on a walk or a concern is linked to a walking club member.

**Key information for the site**

- What is safeguarding?
- Signs to watch out for.
- Action steps.
- Contact page with links and information on how to report an issue.
- Information about the club, upcoming walks and training.

### User Stories

Add your user stories here. You want to include first time visitors and returning visitors here as a minimum. Think about each group, and the experience and journey you want them to have on your site. It really helps to think about this before you start coding, and will really help with creating your wireframes.

**First Time Visitor Goals**

- To find information about the walking club.
- To find information on safeguarding related to the club.
- To to be able to navigate the site easily to find the information they need.
- To connect to the club's social sites.

**Returning Visitor Goals**

- To be able to see the up to date information on meetings and training.
- To access the contact form quickly.

## Design

I knew I wanted the club to have a logo, so I began by drawing out a very rough design. I then asked Microsoft Copilot to produce a logo with the description and design features I required. 

Starting Idea: 

![Initial sketch of logo](assets/images/image_50373889.JPG)

Final design from Copilot: 

![Final logo design](assets/images/Walking%20Boot%20Shield%20Logo%20with%20Hills%20in%20a%20different%20color%20scheme.webp)

### Colour Scheme

Following on from the logo design, I was able to extract the colours via Adobe Color in order to create a colour scheme for the website as a whole. The range of blues alongside the brown will help to provide a feel of the outdoors and the freedom the walks can give to people. The shade of cream is also gentle and allows for good contrast. 

![Logo Colour Scheme](assets/images/logo-colour-scheme.png)

The contrast was tested for accessibility:

### Typography

I have used Google Fonts to import the chosen fonts for the website. 

I have chosen to use Chelsea Market by Tart Workshop for headings. This font has a rustic feel which replicates the outdoors, whilst being clear to read.

![Chealsea Market font reference](assets/images/font1.png)

I have chosen to use Merriweather Sans by Sorkin Type for paragraphs. For larger blocks of text, this sans serif font is simple and clear to read.

### Imagery

The imagery focusses on both group togetherness on hikes and safeguarding. I have mostly used photography from UnSplash and my own library. I have used AI generated images for the logo and hero image on the contact page. I used Copilot to create the hero image. This allowed me to depict a scene of togetherness whilst highlghting that sometimes people who are vulnerable and struggling can be hidden in plain sight. 

The images have been credited in the [credits](#credits) section of the ReadMe.

### Wireframes

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

## Technologies Used

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Technologies Used section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#Technologies-Used)

### Languages Used

HTML
CSS

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

## Deployment & Local Development

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Deployment & Local Development section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Deployment)

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)

## Credits

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Credits section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/BookWorm#Credits)

The Credits section is where you can credit all the people and sources you used throughout your project.

### Code Used

If you have used some code in your project that you didn't write, this is the place to make note of it. Credit the author of the code and if possible a link to where you found the code. You could also add in a brief description of what the code does, or what you are using it for here.

### Content

Who wrote the content for the website? Was it yourself - or have you made the site for someone and they specified what the site was to say? This is the best place to put this information.

###  Media

If you have used any media on your site (images, audio, video etc) you can credit them here. I like to link back to the source where I found the media, and include where on the site the image is used.
  
###  Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
